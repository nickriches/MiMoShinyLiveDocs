# Making copies of the app

The app is hosted on GitHub pages, and will work as long as it does not exceed their permitted bandwidth. Because processing takes place in the browser, rather than on a server, I don't anticipate that this will happen.

However, if you wish to be absolutely sure that the app will run at all times there are two things you could consider.

## 1. Running offline

Firstly, you can download the app.R file from github, and just run it. Before you do so, you will need to install a variety of packages using the following commands;

1. For the MiMo app

```
requiredpackages <- c('shiny', 'DT', 'dplyr',
'stringr', 'udpipe' 'textcat', 'zoo',
'koRpus', 'koRpus.lang.en', 'colourpicker')

install_load <- function(packages){
     for (p in packages) {
          if (p %in% rownames(installed.packages())) {
               library(p, character.only=TRUE)
          } else {
               install.packages(p)
               library(p,character.only = TRUE)
          }
     }
}

install_load(requiredpackages)

```

1. For the MiMo norms

```
requiredpackages <- c('shiny', 'ggplot2', 'dplyr', 'zoo')

install_load <- function(packages){
     for (p in packages) {
          if (p %in% rownames(installed.packages())) {
               library(p, character.only=TRUE)
          } else {
               install.packages(p)
               library(p,character.only = TRUE)
          }
     }
}

install_load(requiredpackages)

```

Note that if you do this you will still need to have your computer connected to the internet this is because (a) the MiMo app needs to download the Universal Dependency grammar (b) the MiMo app reads the normative data from a specially made github page.

It should also be noted that some of the hyperlinks at the top of the page will not work because they point to existing web locations.

## 2. Creating your own copy of the app on github pages

This is a good option if you want to absolutely ensure that there are no bandwidth issues. To do this you just need to clone the repo, and set it up using github pages. An LLM such as ChatGPT or Claude will give you advice on how to do this.
