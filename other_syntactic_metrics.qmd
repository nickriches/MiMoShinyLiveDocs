## Number of Utterances (NUtts)

This is just the number of utterances per participant (with each utterance delimited by sentence-final punctuation)

## Mean Number of Clauses per Utterance (MNumCl)

This is calculated from the number of **finite** verbs per utterance. So it will miss any **non-finite** clauses. If you want to see how MiMo is doing the calculations, you can find a column called `num_fin_clause` in the `Let's explore > (1) Coloured output` tab.

## Mean Length of Turn (MLT)

This is the mean number of utterances per conversational turn.
